# `cryodecoder` - decode CryoEgg and CryoWurst packets
**Record, process and store packets from Cryo* instruments and receivers.**

## What is the purpose of this package?
1. Help strip and read fields from data packets generated by Cryo* instruments
2. Convert raw data to meaningful values
3. Provide several mechanisms for logging data from Cryo* instruments (text files, SQL database, upload to external server).

## `Packet` objects and the Generic Packet Reader
The backbone of `cryodecoder`, the 'generic packet reader' uses packet formats defined in a TOML file to provide a human-readable specification for the format of each packet. 

For each type of `Packet`, this specification lists functions in a Python class that convert the raw bytes into a valid raw numeric, string or other value.

## `Data` objects - abstracting interpretation from raw data
The sensor payloads on Cryo* instruments are customisable and hence interpretation of the sensed parameter from its raw value requires prior-knowledge of how to convert the data.

Abstracting interpretation of the raw data from the `Packet` objects into `Data` classes, which are generated from packets allows for sensor-specific interprations of the data to be made.

## Todo
- Write a script to convert Cryo* packets from the receiver SD files (binary format) to human readable CSV or similar.
- Implement framework for general packets received by Cryo* receiver
    - Add subclasses for CryoEgg and CryoWurst packets (including different packet types)
